- Azure Worlds uses BlitzMax NG. It will be rewritten in C# at an undetermined point in the future.
- Code must be bug free, or at the very least fully functional with understandable bugs, and sent to me in a pull request.
- I will review the code, and then accept it into the project.

If you submit enough good code you will be made a contributor.
